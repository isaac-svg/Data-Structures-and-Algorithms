Using two Stacks

1. Implementing Queues:

    This is the most common use case. By using two stacks, you can mimic the push/pop behavior of a queue:
        push: Push onto one stack (let's call it in)
        pop: Pop from the other stack (let's call it out). If out is empty, reverse the elements of in onto out, effectively transferring them.

2. Undo/Redo Functionality:

    Store user actions or program states in one stack for undo and in another for redo, enabling backwards and forwards functionality in editors, image manipulation tools, etc.

3. Expression Evaluation:

    Use one stack for operands and another for operators while processing expressions in reverse Polish notation (postfix notation).

4. Parsing Trees:

    Implement Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) tree traversals using two stacks, one for keeping track of nodes to visit and another for storing processed nodes.

5. Recursive Function Alternative:

    For simple recursive functions, convert them to iterative versions using two stacks to manage function calls and return values, avoiding potential recursion depth problems.

6. Efficient String Reversal:

    Push characters onto one stack, then pop and print them from the other to achieve reversal without creating a new string or in-place modifications.

7. Balancing Algorithms:

    Implement algorithms like the two-stack sorting algorithm or balancing parentheses in expressions using two stacks.

8. Infix to Postfix Conversion:

    Use two stacks to convert infix expressions (standard mathematical notation) to postfix expressions (reverse Polish notation) for easier evaluation.

9. Graph Traversal:

    Implement DFS or BFS on graphs using two stacks, one for unvisited nodes and another for visited nodes.

10. Backtracking Algorithms:

    Use two stacks to track possible solutions and backtrack when necessary in problems like maze solving or Sudoku.



    Combining Stacks and Queues


Combining Stacks and Queues in Software Engineering


1. Deque (Double-Ended Queue):

    This popular data structure allows insertion and deletion from both ends, resembling a hybrid of a stack and a queue.
    Implement it using two stacks: one for "front" elements and another for "back" elements.
    Push to the front stack for push_front and back stack for push_back.
    Pop from either stack depending on which end is chosen (pop_front or pop_back).

2. Undo/Redo Functionality (Enhanced):

    Expand on the basic undo/redo using stacks by providing multiple levels of undo or redo.
    Use two stacks for each level: one for storing states and another for keeping track of the order.
    This allows multiple undos and redos within each level, maintaining a history of operations.

3. Breadth-First Search with Level Information:

    In graph traversals, use one stack for storing nodes at the current level (like traditional BFS) and another for recording the previous level.
    This efficiently keeps track of level information along with node visitation, aiding in algorithms like level-order traversal or finding the shortest path with a specific depth constraint.

4. Multilevel Backtracking:

    Backtracking algorithms often explore options iteratively. Introduce levels in exploration using two stacks: one for the current level and another for storing backtracking points from previous levels.
    This enables efficient backtracking between multiple solution branches without losing track of overall exploration progress.

5. Efficient Parsing with Lookahead:

    When parsing complex textual formats, use a stack for the main parsing process and another for storing potential next tokens ("lookahead").
    This allows peeking ahead without committing to a decision, aiding in error correction or disambiguation while maintaining parsing context.

6. Efficient Memory Management:

    Implement object pools using stacks for pre-allocated objects and another for deallocated objects.
    This promotes fast object allocation and reuse, avoiding frequent dynamic memory allocation/deallocation overhead.

7. Implementing Priority Queues (Customizable):

    While std::priority_queue offers flexibility, create a custom implementation using two stacks based on your specific priority rules.
    Use one stack for storing elements and another for keeping track of their priorities.
    This allows fine-grained control over prioritization logic and data structures tailored to your use case.
